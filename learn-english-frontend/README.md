# Learn English with Serverless and GenAI - Backend

[Read the context of the project here.](../README.md)

That's an Angular project

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## To do

I didn't finish creating a deploy of this frontend to AWS, so for now you need to deploy this manually :(
